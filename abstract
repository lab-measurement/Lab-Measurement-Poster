Lab::Measurement is a collection of Perl modules providing control of Test &
Measurement devices. It allows for quickly setting up varying and evolving
complex measurement tasks involving diverse hardware.
It supports instruments connected by various means as GPIB, USB-TMC or VXI-11
(Ethernet). Internally, backends as e.g. Linux-GPIB or National Instrumentsâ€™
NI-VISA library are used as well as leightweight drivers for USB
and TCP/IP-based protocols. The wide range of supported connection
backends 
enables cross-platform portability. Dedicated instrument driver classes relieve
the user from taking care of internal or vendor-specific details.
A high-level layer enables fast and flexible creation
of nested measurement loops, where e.g. several input variables are varied and
output datafiles together with metadata are logged in a user-specified folder
structure. 
Lab::Measurement has already been
successfully used in several low temperature transport spectroscopy setups. It
is free software and available at http://www.labmeasurement.de/
